<h1>A Coffin&mdash;is a Small Domain</h1>
<p>A Coffin&mdash;is a small Domain,<br> Yet able to contain<br>A Citizen of Paradise<br> In it diminished Plane.</p>
<p>A Grave&mdash;is a restricted Breadth&mdash;<br>Yet ampler than the Sun&mdash;<br>And all the Seas He populates<br>And Lands He looks upon</p>
<p>To Him who on its small Repose<br>Bestows a single Friend&mdash;<br>Circumference without Relief<br>&mdash;Or Estimate&mdash;or End&mdash;</p>
<i>Emily Dickinson</i>
