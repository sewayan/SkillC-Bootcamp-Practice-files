<h1> The one thing that makes me want to code </h1>
<p> The reason I started looking into actual writing code, is that I am missing something essential in my current work-style.<br>As interesting and sometimes even rewarding all the "functional" consulting tasks may be <i>actually</i> creating something and controlling the process, rather than just outsourcing and then testing it is an incredible rewarding feeling.  </p>
<p>Besides that, one should <strong>NEVER</strong> stop learning!</p>
<p> Here is my list of languages I am currently learning: </p>
<ol>
    <li> HTML </li>
    <li> CSS </li>
    <li> Javascript </li>
    	<ul> <li>Framework: 			JQuery </li> 			</ul>
    <li> Python </li>
